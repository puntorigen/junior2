Junior is a command-line tool that provides automated support for working with your current local folder, like code development or document management. This tool can generate code snippets, refactor project structures, generate file analysis and documentation, add methods to an existing class, generate unit tests, create a dockerFile for any project, and much more. Plugins can also be used to extend the functionality. The final intention is to make it as autonomous as posible, much like 'devin', but for the command-line.

## Features

- **Code Generation**: 'junior' can generate code snippets in multiple languages based on user input.

- **Project Structure Generation**: It can generate smart project structures for different types of applications.

- **Code Execution**: 'junior' can execute custom actions defined by the user based on input commands. Plugins can be used to execute almost any type of action.

- **Context Awareness**: It can understand the context of a project and provide appropriate support.

## Usage examples

The following are some examples of how to use 'junior':

- To generate a README file for a project folder:
  ```bash
